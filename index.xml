      <description>Microphones are unnatural things and can bring out overtones in the voice that the listener wouldn’t normally be bothered by. I’m always battling to make the music sound like real music coming through the unforgiving speakers, and routinely spend at least an hour automating EQ on individual syllables on a lead vocal.
soothe is a magic wand for lead vocals. It keeps all the voice and takes away the harsh anomalies of what happens when you put a microphone a few centimeters away from a singer’s mouth.</description>

      <description>soothe is like magic, removes those nasty peaks and annoying frequencies you spend so much time trying to remove.
I wish I had this tool back when I mixed the talkbox for One Smile. One weeks job cut down to just minutes.
Also, apply soothe to cymbals to make them less ringing and easier to fit into the mix.</description>

      <description>soothe is a true gem. It&amp;rsquo;s been a tremendous timesaver during my production process - especially during vocal production and mixing, but it also shines on numerous other sounds.
soothe does with ease what used to take hours and hours of tweaking. It manages to stay true to the original character of a signal while removing unpleasant resonances in a very musical way - and all of that dynamically, on an unlimited number of bands, in real time.</description>

      <description>I’ve been waiting years for someone to design a plugin that does what soothe does. Dynamic EQs and soft saturators never seem to do the job in a musical way and required a lot of tweaking and fussing. soothe does in minutes what used to take hours. This plugin will pay for itself very quickly in time saved.</description>

      <description>The update 1.1.0 for soothe is a free update, so no need for upgrade.
Just download the new version from here and install, your existing license has already been deployed. You can activate the plugin by logging into new license manager web app by using the same credential you&amp;rsquo;ve last used to activate the plugin. If you need to change your password, please use the lost password functionality in the license manager web app.</description>

      <description>soothe audio processor Dynamic resonance suppressor for mid and high frequencies
soothe is our first release in the line of modern audio processors by oeksound. Originally designed as vocal processor, the plugin gives you the perfect, in control, world class vocal sound you’ve been striving for, with unmatched ease.
So long, notching soothe is a dynamic equaliser with self-adjusting frequency bands. Unlike traditional EQ-tools, soothe analyses the signal on the fly and adjusts the frequency-wise reduction based on the input.</description>
